/*
 * Red Black Tree Insertion
 * ------------------------
 *
 * This function fixes colors after a node has been inserted in a red-black
 * tree. The recently inserted node is painted red. Then, color are fixed
 * backwards so as not break red-black tree rules. The loop begins at step #2.
 *
 * 1] If the node is the root of the tree, it is colored black and the
 * operation is over as it adds a black node to every path of the tree.
 *
 * 2] The operation is over as well if the parent of the node is black as
 * rules remain satisfied.
 *
 * 3] The node as a red parent, which induces that it also has a grandparent
 * as the root of tree is black. If the node has a red uncle, then the parent
 * and the uncle are turned black while the grandparent is turned red. This
 * does not violate the 4th rule. The operation has to go on with the
 * grandparent as it could still break the other rules.
 *
 * 4] Now, either the node has no uncle or its uncle is painted black, like a
 * Rolling Stone. If the parent is a left (resp. right) child and the node a
 * right (resp. left), then a left (resp. right) rotation will invert their
 * roles, as follows:
 *
 *        _g[b]__                         __g[b]_
 *       /       \                       /       \
 *    p[r]        u[b]     ==>        n[r]        u[b]
 *    /  \        /  \                /  \        /  \
 * A[b]  n[r]  D[?]  E[?]          p[r]  C[b]  D[?]  E[?]
 *       /  \                      /  \
 *    B[b]  C[b]                A[b]  B[b]
 *
 * The rotation is safe as both the node and its parent are red and properties
 * are not violated in any sub-tree.
 *
 * 5] The former parent has to be dealt with, however, as it breaks the 3rd
 * rule. Now, we know that parent and node are either both left (resp. right)
 * children. Thus, a right (resp. left) rotation rooted at the child of the
 * grand parent (e.g. the parent or the former node according to the previous
 * configuration) will make the former grandparent a child of the parent.
 * Then, switching colors of both nodes will restore the rules and the
 * operation is complete.
 *
 *           __g[b]_                      _p[r->b]_
 *          /       \                    /         \
 *       p[r]        u[b]             n[r]          g[b->r]
 *       /  \        /  \             /  \          /     \
 *    n[r]  C[b]  D[?]  E[?]  ==>  A[b]  B[b]    C[b]     u[b]

 * Red Black Tree Removal
 * ----------------------
 *
 * This function fixes colors after a node has been removed from a red-black
 * tree.
 *
 * If the removed node was red, then we are done as no black path has changed
 * at all.
 *
 * Now, we know the removed node was black. It was replaced by one of its
 * children. If this child is red, then, we repaint it black to restore black
 * height.
 *
 * Otherwise, the child is black. If its sibling is red, it is possible to
 * rotate the sub-tree so that it becomes the parent of the parent. Colors
 * have to be exchanged between both of them to avoid breaking rules once
 * more. This insures the sibling is black for the remainder of the
 * discussion. Here, we based the algorithm that it can be proven that a
 * sibling always exists in that case.
 *
 * If both sibling's children are black (or if the sibling is a leaf), then
 * repainting the sibling red will make all paths across it contain the same
 * number of black node as those passing through the node. Now, the parent
 * itself has to be examined as it still breaks the rules since all paths
 * through it have one fewer black node. If it is red, then we repaint it
 * black to add the missing black node in the path and we are done.
 *
 * If sibling's children have different colors, we insure that the sibling has
 * a red child in the same direction as the node. If not, a rotation in the
 * opposite direction rooted at sibling will do it. Colors are exchanged
 * between the former and the new sibling. As a result, number of black nodes
 * are kept unchanged.
 *
 * Now, a rotation rooted at the parent in the direction of the child will
 * make the sibling the parent of the former parent. The new parent gets the
 * former parent's color. Painting its children black will restore red/black
 * properties. Paths passing through the removed node have one additional
 * black node. Other paths either pass through its sibling or its uncle. The
 * first ones are ok since parent and sibling colors have not changed. Thoses
 * passing through the new uncle, have got one new black node as one node was
 * changed from red to black, balancing the node they lost during the
 * rotation.
