 *
 * @brief Containers references
 *
 * Containers are objects that allows building collections of homogeneous
 * data, so-called elements. They are of two main types. Sequential containers
 * stores elements in a raw. Associative containers stores elements in an
 * ordered manner.
 *
 * At glance, sequential containers are fast for adding and removing elements
 * but behave poorly when being searched. Associative containers require
 * elements to be comparable. They are slower for insertion and removal but
 * provide efficient search algorithms.
 *
 * Containers use references to keep track of elements. A reference is a data
 * structure that holds one or several pointer to other references.
 *
 * Elements contains a reference as a member. It is possible to dereference a
 * reference to get the pointer of the element it is bound to using
 * b6_cast_of. Here is an example with a simply-linked reference:
 *
 * @code
 * struct element {
 * 	...
 * 	struct b6_sref sref;
 * 	...
 * };
 *
 * struct element *foo(struct b6_sref *ref)
 * {
 *  	return b6_cast_of(ref, struct element, sref);
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Note that not every reference is linked to an element: every container has
 * head and tail references that are placed before and after any reference
 * within the container respectively. It is illegal to dereference them.
 *
 * @see b6_sref, b6_dref, b6_tref
 * @see deque.h, list.h, vector.h, splay.h, tree.h
